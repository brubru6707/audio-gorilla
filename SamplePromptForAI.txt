MultiStep Prompt format examples (THE PROMPTS HAVE TO BE DIRECT AND NOT OPEN FOR MULTITURNS AND THE 

CONTEXTS HAVE TO HAVE THE CURRENT USER ID FOR THE APIS BEING USED THROUGH THE PROMPT):

{

  "prompt": "Order a new smartwatch from Amazon and add the delivery date to my Google Calendar",

  "tools": ["AmazonApis", "GoogleCalendarApis"],

  "context": {

    "amazon_current_user": "15ca4c07-750a-476f-92c3-bd882642fb06",

    "googlecalendar_current_user": "4fd2b8e4-bdae-457e-a389-eeb860695243"

  }

},

{

  "prompt": "Send an SMS to Bob Johnson about our meeting tomorrow and then email him the meeting agenda",

  "tools": ["CommuniLinkApis", "GmailApis"],

  "context": {

    "communilink_current_user": "d3006f08-3e70-4e57-820c-ef788dc84926",

    "gmail_current_user": "0c90eec2-8bef-47a9-ace9-5edd79232548"

  }

},



ALSO, I WANT YOU TO ADD ANOTHER KEY CALLED ground_truth THAT CONTAINS A LIST OF EXAMPLE FUNCTION SIGNATURES THAT WOULD BE CALLED

FROM THE API TOOLS LIKE {"Amazon": login(user: str), search_products(query: str, user: str),  "Gmail": sendEmail(user: str, body: str, to: str) }



MultiTurn Prompt FORMAT EXAMPLES ARE THE EXACT SAME, BUT THEY HAVE A KEY (LIKE turn1, user1, turn2 user2, turn3, user 3) WHERE

turn1 IS THE AI MODEL IS EITHER CALLING THE NECESSARY FUNCTIONS (SOMETHING LIKE A LIST OF FUNCTION SIGNAUTURES/SIGNATURE LIKE FOR MultiStep) OR CHANGING THE BACKEND (LIKE {"notes_counter": 2}). user1 WOULD BE IN RESPONSE TO turn1 

WHERE IT GIVES THE MODEL MORE INFORMATION. turn2 WOULD BE THE AI MODEL USING THE RESPONSE FROM user 1 TO CALL THE NECESSARY FUNCTIONS

OR CHANGE THE BACKEND



APIS USED: Gmail, CommuniLink, Amazon, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Simple Notes
